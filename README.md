## Overview

> A mass shooting is when four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling off period.

[Shooting Tracker](http://www.shootingtracker.com), is a website built by members of a Reddit forum supporting gun control called [GunsAreCool](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/). The site aggregates (via crowdsourcing) news stories about shooting incidents — of any kind — in which four or more people are reported to have been either injured or killed.

## Caveats

As with all scientific analyses, the sample collection methodology is very important. You should be aware that:

* [Shooting Tracker](http://www.shootingtracker.com) crowdsources data. [Problems have been identified with field definitions](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/427985/media-mass-shootings-count-misleading) - for example, what constitues a wounded victim. You should make your own conclusions as to wether this tolerance is acceptable.

* [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data) is arguably somewhat more reliable than [Shooting Tracker](http://www.shootingtracker.com) - they claim the data is being used by academic researchers, legislative aides, and law enforcement officials. Again, I cannot confirm the accuracy of this dataset. Do your own due dilligence.

* Some of the datasets used are outdated - generally because more recent data is unobtainable. Again, the timeline of each dataset is cited below for your reference.
